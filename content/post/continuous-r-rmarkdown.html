<p>In my qualifying exam, in the written part, I was asked about how to analyze the effect of continuous, not binary, treatment using propensity score analysis. I skipped it for the written but I spent a few days looking up how to analyze this in case I would be asked during my oral examination. Sadly, no one asked me even when I asked them to, so here is a blog detailing my explorations.</p>
<div id="binary-treatment" class="section level1">
<h1>Binary Treatment</h1>
<p>For a review of propensity score analysis with binary treatment, please see Stuart (2010). Below let <span class="math inline">\(e(X)\)</span> denote propensity score, <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> denote a binary treatment, and <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> denote all the observed confounders. In the case of binary treatment, propensity scores represent the probability of receiving treatment given the covariates:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[e(X) = P(D = 1|X)\]</span></p>
<p>We estimate the scores using logistic regression or machine learning techniques like generalized boosted models.</p>
</div>
<div id="extension-to-contiuous-treatment" class="section level1">
<h1>Extension to Contiuous Treatment</h1>
<p>In binary treatment context, we assume that the potential outcomes (<span class="math inline">\(Y(1)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y(0)\)</span>) are independent of treatment given <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Y(1), Y(0) \perp\!\!\!\perp D |X\]</span></p>
<p>and by extension are independent given the propensity scores:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Y(0), Y(1) \perp\!\!\!\perp D|e(X)\]</span></p>
<p>Hirano and Imbens (2004) introduced the assumption of weak unconfoundedness in the context of continuous treatment. They stated: “we do not require joint independence of all potential outcomes. Instead, we require conditional independence to hold for each value of the treatment.” Below, let <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> denote a continuous treatment variable. The potential outcome when <span class="math inline">\(T = t\)</span> is unreated to the treatment given the set of covariates:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Y(t) \perp\!\!\!\perp T |X\]</span></p>
<p>To calculate the propensity scores, in the case of continuous treatment, we cannot find the probability that continuous treatment (<span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>) equals a given value <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. The likelihood of continuous variables taking on a given value is zero. For continuous treatment variable, we find the conditional density, the probability that <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is infinitely close to <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> given <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. Below let <span class="math inline">\(r(t,x)\)</span> denote the propensity scores. The right hand side of the equation represents the probability density function of a normal distribution. To estimate the propensity scores, we need to run a linear regression predicting the treatment by a set of covariates (Austin, 2019). From that we get the fitted values (<span class="math inline">\(X\hat{\beta}\)</span>) and the model variance, (<span class="math inline">\({\sigma}^2\)</span>) (Austin, 2019). The fitted values take the place of the mean in the density function.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ r(t, x) = {f_{T|X}}^{(t|x)} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\hat{\sigma}^2}} e^{-\frac{(t - X\hat{\beta})^2}{2\pi\hat{\sigma}^2}}\]</span></p>
<p>Conditional on the propensity scores, we can assume that each potential outcome is independent of treatment:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Y(t) \perp\!\!\!\perp T |r(t,x)\]</span></p>
<p>Hirano and Imbens (2004) state that: “Within strata with the same value of <span class="math inline">\(r(t,X)\)</span>, the probability that <span class="math inline">\(T = t\)</span> does not depend on the value of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.” I have seen <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> in front of the <span class="math inline">\((T = t)\)</span>, denoting the indicator function (Hirano &amp; Imbens, 2004; Bia &amp; Mattei, 2008).</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[X \perp\!\!\!\perp 1(T = t)|r(t,x)\]</span></p>

<div id="calculating-weights" class="section level1">
<h1>Calculating Weights</h1>
<p>Following the same logic as the inverse propensity weights (IPW) for the estimation of the average treatment effect (ATE) for a binary treatment, we calculate the inverse of the propensity scores as the weights:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{1}{{f_{T|X}}^{(t|x)}}\]</span></p>
<p>However, Robins et al. (2000) noted that such weights can result in infinite variance (Austin, 2019). They suggested to use stabilized weights as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{{f_{T}}^{(t)}}{{f_{T|X}}^{(t|x)}}\]</span></p>
<p>Here the numerator represents the marginal density of treatment:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{f_{T}}^{(t)} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\hat{\sigma_t}^2}} e^{-\frac{(t - \mu_t)^2}{2\pi\hat{\sigma_t}^2}}\]</span></p>
<p>The stabilized weights make the distribution of the IPW narrower as there is less difference between the numerators and the denominators (van der Wal &amp; Geskus, 2011).</p>

<h1>Real Data Analysis Example</h1>
<p>The data that I use here is from High School and Beyond (HSB) longitudinal study used by Rosenbaum (1986) to analyze the effect of dropping out of high school of later math achievement. The missing data in the original dataset have been replaced with one iteration of imputation using <code>mice</code>. This is not an appropriate method to analyze missing data but for the purpose of the example I am just using the one complete data. For the sake of this example, let’s analyze the effect of math efficacy on later math achievement.</p>
<div id="loading-the-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Loading the Data</h2>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)

dat &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meghapsimatrix/R_practice/master/Data/HSLS09_complete.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="the-numerators" class="section level2">
<h2>The Numerators</h2>
<p>Here I am getting the numerators of the IPW, the marginal densities. I have regressed math_efficacy on just the intercept and used <code>dnorm</code> function to extract the densities.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># the numerator
mod_num &lt;- lm(math_efficacy ~ 1, data = dat)

num &lt;- dnorm(x = dat$math_efficacy, # treatment 
             mean = fitted.values(mod_num), # fitted values
             sd = summary(mod_num)$sigma) # model sigma</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="the-denominators" class="section level2">
<h2>The Denominators</h2>
<p>Here I am getting the denominators of the IPW, the conditional densities. I have regressed math_efficacy on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and used <code>dnorm</code> function to extract the densities. I am not quite sure whether to use the model sigma which divides the sum of errors squared by the degrees of freedom before taking the square root or whether I should just take the standard deviation of the errors. However, with large sample size the difference between the two are negligible.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># the demonimator
mod_den &lt;- lm(math_efficacy ~ sex + race + language + repeated_grade + IEP + locale + region + SES, data = dat)

den &lt;- dnorm(x = dat$math_efficacy, # treatment variable
             mean = fitted.values(mod_den), # fitted values
             sd = summary(mod_den)$sigma)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="the-ipw" class="section level2">
<h2>The IPW</h2>
<p>Below I calculate the stabilized weights:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dat &lt;- dat %&gt;%

<h2>Checking Balance and Outcome Analysis</h2>
<p>Please check back on my next post :) Short story: For balance, we have to calculate weighted correlations, and for outcome analysis we estimate the expected outcome for each treatment level and compare (Austin, 2019).</p>
